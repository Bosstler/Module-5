# Module-5
## Overview

I wrote a program that converted currency values as a Java project that provides a web-based interface for exchanging/converting money from one currency to another. this application will be applicable for business, shares & finance-related areas.

Writing this software gave me the needed experience to understand Java in a way that will benefit my future career as a developer.
